  <h2 class="title-color">Description</h2>
  <p>This simple potato, flour, and egg recipe is one my family has used for generations.</p>
  <h2 class="title-color">Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 potatoes</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="title-color">Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Step 1</li>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Peel potatoes and add to pot. Cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and mash with a fork or potato masher.</p>
    <li>Step 2</li>
    <p>Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a ball. Shape small portions of the dough into long "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes into half-inch pieces.</p>
    <li>Step 3</li>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.</p>
